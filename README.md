The purepose of the DNA analysis tool is to identify who a DNA sequence may belong to based on a given DNA sequence of an unknown person using a DNA database. The implementation creates and stores DNA profiles with personalized information like the person's name and their STRs/Short Tandem Repeats. Considering that human DNA is extremely similar amongst everyone, the program will focus on the 0.1% that makes everyone's DNA different, the noncoding DNA. Information is stored all in a database-like structure using BSTs. For data fetching, the implementation includes the option to add, remove, search for, and flag specific profiles within the BST database. You could imagine a large set of profiles set into this database-like structure to quicken and automate the searching process of an unknown DNA sequence. The program utilizes in-order and level-order traversals for search, and a standard insertion method to look for proper positioning in the BST - ordered by name.

I would like to note that this was an assigned class project. The author/creator of the assignment was Kal Pandit (Head TA of the DSA class). Aside from folder and functions structure, most implementation was done by me, Zahir Rivas.
